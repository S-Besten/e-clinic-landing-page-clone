# e-clinic-landing-page-clone
This is my first HTML/CSS project.
I recreated the e-clinic wep app landing page in my health facility.
This project was focused on the use of <code><div><code> and its nesting possibilities.
It also focused on alignment and justification of HTML elements.
This project was completed without any prior review of the source code.
