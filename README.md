# e-clinic-landing-page-clone
This is my first HTML/CSS project.
I recreated the e-clinic wep app landing page of my health facility.
This project was focused on the use of div element and its nesting possibilities.
It also focused on alignment and justification of HTML elements.
This project was completed without any prior review of the source code.
